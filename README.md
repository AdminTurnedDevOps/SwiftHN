##### ETA

* Currently link with [libHN](https://github.com/bennyguitar/libHN)
* Basic UI (already works for news feed comsuption!)
* Protocol (for delegation pattern)
* Frameworks use & example
* Live view rendering
* Class Extensions
* Workaround some Swift/Xcode 6 bugs
* More...

At the moment concept screens and feature are mostly done in Sketch, I'll integrate them as Apple relase betas with new APIs. 
But there is already a working app + today extension coming soon.
